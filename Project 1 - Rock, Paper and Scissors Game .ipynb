    "**DESCRIPTION :**  \n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook contains a Python implementation of the classic game **\"Rock, Paper, Scissors\"**. The game is a simple yet entertaining way to pass the time, pitting two players against each other in a battle of wits and luck.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules are straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "**- Rock beats scissors**  \n",
    "**- Scissors beats paper**  \n",
    "**- Paper beats rock**  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this implementation, the user can play against the computer. The user is prompted to input their choice, and the computer randomly selects its choice (rock, paper, or scissors). The program then determines the winner based on the rules mentioned above and displays the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code serves as a fun and educational introduction to basic Python programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and random number generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Feel free to run the code and challenge yourself to see who reigns supreme in this classic game of strategy and chance!*"
